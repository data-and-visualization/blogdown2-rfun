      <description>This fall the Data &amp;amp; Visualization Services Department hosted a five-part workshop series on the R programming language. Our goal: introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation by highlighting a basic set of packages that enable functional and practical data science. To that end, we approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse. We believe this tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces workflows, analysis and reporting.</description>

      <description>On October 2nd, I presented a Mapping with R workshop hosted by the Data and Visualization Services Department.
R has become a popular and reproducible option for supporting spatial and statistical analysis. This hands-on workshop will demonstrate how to plot x/y coordinates using leaflet; how to generate thematic choropleths with US Census and other federal data (using tmap and tidycensus); import, view and produce shapefiles; and create leaflet maps for viewing on the web.</description>

      <description>On September 25, 2017 Angela Zoss (DVS Staff page) presented a visualization workshop hosted by the Data and Visualization Services Department.
The workshops, officially entitled Visualization in R using ggplot2, is a two-hour, hands-on learning session designed to introduce the ggplot2 package, a programming library within the R programming language. The ggplot2 library for R creates clear and well-designed visualizations that plays well with other tidyverse packages.
Data science skills are increasingly important for research and industry projects.</description>

      <description>On September 18, 2017 Sophia Lafferty-Hess (DVS Staff page), Jen Darragh (DVS Staff page), and I presented a Reproducibility workshop hosted by the Data and Visualization Services Department and cross-listed with the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training efforts.
The workshops, officially entitled Reproducibility: Data Management, Git, and RStudio is a two-hour, hands-on response to a growing focus on the importance of reproducibility, replication, and transparency in the research endeavor. General data management strategies are introduced to assist researchers in their efforts towards increased research reproducibility.</description>
