      <description>This past spring the Data &amp;amp; Visualization Services Department hosted a six-part workshop series on the R programming language. Our goals for the workshop series is to introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation. We do this by highlighting a basic set of packages that enable functional and practical data science. We approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse.</description>

      <description>This winter the Data &amp;amp; Visualization Services Department will once again host a workshop series on the R programming language. Our spring offering is modeled on our well received R we having fun yetâ€½ (Rfun) fall workshop series. The four-part series will introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation by highlighting a set of tidyverse packages that enable functional data science. We will approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse.</description>
