      <description>This past spring the Data &amp;amp; Visualization Services Department hosted a six-part workshop series on the R programming language. Our goals for the workshop series is to introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation. We do this by highlighting a basic set of packages that enable functional and practical data science. We approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse.</description>

      <description>This fall the Data &amp;amp; Visualization Services Department hosted a five-part workshop series on the R programming language. Our goal: introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation by highlighting a basic set of packages that enable functional and practical data science. To that end, we approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse. We believe this tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces workflows, analysis and reporting.</description>
