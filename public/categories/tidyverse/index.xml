      <description>Joel Herndon and I regularly present sections of the Intro to R Workshop hosted by the Data and Visualization Services Department.
The workshops &amp;ndash; official entitled Intro to R: Data Transformations, Data Structures, and the Tidyverse &amp;ndash; is a the two-hour, hands-on session designed to provide a gentle introduction to the basics of the Tidyverse data science approach to the R statistical programming language. We use the RStudio development environment. Attendees learn about managing R projects, data types, variable assignments, data wrangling and visualization, and mapping using a focused approach to modern data science known as the tidyverse.</description>

      <description>This winter the Data &amp;amp; Visualization Services Department will once again host a workshop series on the R programming language. Our spring offering is modeled on our well received R we having fun yetâ€½ (Rfun) fall workshop series. The four-part series will introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation by highlighting a set of tidyverse packages that enable functional data science. We will approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse.</description>
