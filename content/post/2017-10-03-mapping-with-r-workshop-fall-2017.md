On October 2nd, [I](https://johnlittle.info/) presented a **Mapping with R** workshop hosted by the [Data and Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/).

R has become a popular and reproducible option for supporting spatial and statistical analysis. This hands-on workshop will demonstrate how to plot x/y coordinates using *leaflet*; how to generate thematic choropleths with US Census and other federal data (using *tmap* and *tidycensus*); import, view and produce shapefiles; and create leaflet maps for viewing on the web.

The hands-on workshop is designed to introduce the **leaflet**, **tmap**, and **tidycensus** packages.  Each package programming library for use within the R programming language. 

**Learning resources** and **workshop materials** are available and shareable.  Use the links below to learn at your own pace and at the comfort of your own workspace.
