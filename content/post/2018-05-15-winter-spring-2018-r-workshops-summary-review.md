This past spring the [Data & Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data) hosted a six-part workshop series on the R programming language. Our goals for the workshop series is to introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation.  We do this by highlighting a basic set of packages that enable functional and practical data science. We approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).  This tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces workflows, analysis and reporting.  The tidy data approach is good for highlighting work best verified through the lens of reproducible research.

Special Thanks to [Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/) who notably provided two sessions.  The R-Markdown session is very informative.  The session on Shiny is a great primer.  See the links below.

Note:  Due to some video difficulties many of the videos are from the previous semester.  All other links are up to date.

## Workshop Order

This workshop series is intended to be iterative and recursive.  We recommend starting with the *Introduction to R*.  Proceed through the remaining four workshops in any order of most interest, but save the *Shiny* worshop for last.  

As you work through the discussion and hands-on exercises, we invite you to consider how these techniques and tools relate to your personal research projects.  If you have questions about the content of a workshop or are ready to consult about your research, please attend our [walk-in consultation hours](https://library.duke.edu/data/about/schedule) or [send us an email](mailto:askdata@duke.edu?subject=rfun-workshop-question).
