This fall the [Data & Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data) hosted a five-part workshop series on the R programming language. Our goal: introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation by highlighting a basic set of packages that enable functional and practical data science. To that end, we approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).  We believe this tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces workflows, analysis and reporting.  Meanwhile this tidy data approach is good for highlighting work best verified through the lens of reproducible research.

## Resources

## Workshop Order

This workshop series is intended to be iterative and recursive.  We recommend starting with the *Introduction to R*.  Proceed through the remaining four workshops in any order of most interest, but save the *Shiny* worshop for last.  

As you work through the discussion and hands-on exercises, we invite you to consider how these techniques and tools relate to your personal research projects.  If you have questions about the content of a workshop or are ready to consult about your research, please attend our [walk-in consultation hours](https://library.duke.edu/data/about/schedule) or [send us an email](mailto:askdata@duke.edu?subject=rfun-workshop-question).
