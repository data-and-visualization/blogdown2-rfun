<h2>The RFun Series is Back</h2>
<p>Introducing the Fall 2017 RFun Series. Weâ€™ve expanded and transformed the series to add more hands-on training opportunities. Links to registration are below.</p>
<p>Each R workshop will take place on a Monday, beginning in mid-September. Individual workshops will last two hours. The series will extend over four consecutive weeks followed by a brief respite. The fifth and final workshop will introduce Shiny, a package for developing interactive web visualizations. The workshop line-up is intended to gently build knowledge and ensures subsequent sessions remain engaging and practicable.</p>

<h2>Access to Workshop Materials</h2>
<p>Importantly, <strong>advanced registration is not</strong> a conduit to receiving <strong>an announcement</strong> regarding recordings. I note this here to remind people to avoid squatting on limited seating. Squatting is unnecessary since <strong>all workshops will be recorded</strong>. Workshop materials, slide presentations, and data will be <strong>shared publicly following</strong> the actual workshops. See the <a href="http://library.duke.edu/data/news/past-workshops">DVS past workshops</a> page for access and availability.</p>
