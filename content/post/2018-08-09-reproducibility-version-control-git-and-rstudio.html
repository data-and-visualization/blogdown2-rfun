<p>Sophia Lafferty-Hess (<a href="https://library.duke.edu/data/about/staff">DVS Staff page</a>), Jen Darragh (<a href="https://library.duke.edu/data/about/staff">DVS Staff page</a>), and <a href="https://johnlittle.info/">I</a> presented a <strong>Reproducibility</strong> workshop hosted by the <a href="https://library.duke.edu/data/">Data and Visualization Services Department</a> and cross-listed with the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training efforts.</p>
<p>The workshops, officially entitled <em>Reproducibility: RStudio and Git</em> is a hands-on response to the importance of reproducibility, replication, and transparency in the research endeavor. General data management strategies are introduced to assist researchers in their efforts towards increased research reproducibility.</p>
<p>The hands-on exercises focuses on how <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> can work seamlessly together in support of reproducible research.</p>
<p>No previous experience with Git or R is required. However minimal experience with R is a plus due to the interoperable utility of the two specific tools (git and RStudio). Combining the two tools, which build on Râ€™s widely extensible ecosystem, yields a powerful, reproducible-friendly and collaborative-friendly platform. For those who are not familiar with R, RStudio or Git, you may want to view the streaming video link from a previous post: <a href="/2017/09/18/reproducibility-data-management-git-and-rstudio-workshop-fall-2017/">Introduction to R</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Learning resources</strong> and <strong>workshop materials</strong> are available and shareable. The software (R, RStudio, Git) is open-source and free. Use the links below to learn at your own pace and at the comfort of your own workspace.</p>
