On October 2nd, [Joel Herndon](https://joelherndon.info/) presented a workshop on **Shiny** hosted by the [Data and Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/):  *Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny*.

Learn how to leverage your knowledge of R and R Markdown to create compelling, interactive website and interactive documents using the Shiny web application framework.  Shiny makes it easy to transition from desktop based analysis and visualizations to interactive websites without having to learn HTML, CSS, and javascript.  This workshop provides an overview of the shiny framework along with examples and exercises designed to build confidence in developing shiny based documents and websites.  

For those who are not familiar with RStudio you may want to view the streaming video link from a previous post: [Introduction to R](/2017/09/18/reproducibility-data-management-git-and-rstudio-workshop-fall-2017/).
