Coming this spring the [Data & Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data) will once again host a workshop series on the R programming language.  Our spring offering is modeled on our well received *R we having fun yetâ€½* ([Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/)) [fall workshop series](https://rfun.netlify.com/2017/11/06/fall-2017-r-workshops/).   The four-part series will introduce R as a language for modern data manipulation by highlighting a set of tidyverse packages that enable functional data science. We will approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).  We believe this open tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces reproducible workflows, analysis, and reporting.

An official announcement with links to **registration** is forthcoming.  Feel free to subscribe to the [Rfun](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/info/rfun) or [DVS-Announce](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/info/dvs-announce) lists.  Or look to the [DVS Workshop](https://library.duke.edu/data/news) page for official registration links as soon as they are available.

## Workshop Arrangement

This workshop series is intended to be iterative and recursive.  We recommend starting with the *Introduction to R*.  Proceed through the remaining three workshops in any order of interest.  

## Recordings and Past Workshops
We presented a similar version of this workshop series last fall and recorded each session whenever possible.  You can stream past workshops and engage with the shareable data sets at your-own-pace (see the individual *description* links, above.)  Alternatively, all the past workshop resource links are presented in one listicle:  [Rfun recap](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/2017/09/26/visualization-in-r-using-ggplot2-workshop-fall-2017/).
