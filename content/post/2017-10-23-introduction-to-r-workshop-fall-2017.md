In the Fall of 2017 [Joel Herndon](https://joelherndon.info/) and [I](https://johnlittle.info/) presented two sections of the **Intro to R Workshop** hosted by the [Data and Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/).  

The workshops -- official entitled *Introduction to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures*  -- were held on September 11 and October 2.  The focus of the two-hour, hands-on instruction is to provide a gentle introduction to the basics of the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) development environment and the tidyverse. Attendees learn about managing R projects, data types, variable assignments, data wrangling and visualization using a focused approach to modern data science known as the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/). 

Learning resources and workshop materials are available and shareable so you can learn at your own pace.
