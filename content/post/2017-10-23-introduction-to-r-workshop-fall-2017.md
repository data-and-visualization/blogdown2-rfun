[Joel Herndon](https://joelherndon.info/) and [I](https://johnlittle.info/) regularly present  sections of the **Intro to R Workshop** hosted by the [Data and Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/).  

The workshops -- official entitled *Intro to R: Data Transformations, Data Structures, and the Tidyverse*  -- is a the two-hour, hands-on session designed to provide a gentle introduction to the basics of the [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) data science approach to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language.  We use the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) development environment.  Attendees learn about managing R projects, data types, variable assignments, data wrangling and visualization, and mapping using a focused approach to modern data science known as the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/). 

Learning resources and workshop materials are available and shareable so you can learn at your own pace.
