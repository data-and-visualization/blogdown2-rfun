New from last fall and reprised for the spring is the [Flipped quick-start to R series](/portfolio/r_flipped/).  The flipped series' aim is to make remote learning more engaging, less fatiguing.  You will watch the introductory video in advance.  You control the pace of the thirty-minuted advance video.  Optionally watch additional explanatory videos at your discretion.  Exercises, referenced within the video, are recommended and at your own pace.  The Zoom-workshop will start with an open Question/Answer period; questions that arise from the video(s) and exercises.
