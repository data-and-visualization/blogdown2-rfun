Below please find a **brief list of workshop titles offered** through the **Fall of 2018**.  Each title will link to further information about the workshop including a **streamable recording** of the workshop (if available), shareable **code**, presentation **slide decks**, and any further information.  

Currently, the [Data & Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/) is actively organizing our Spring 2019 workshop series -- including the [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/) subseries.  Stay tuned to our channels ([DVS list](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/subscribe/dvs-announce) | [Rfun list](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/subscribe/rfun) | [DVS Twitter](https://twitter.com/duke_data)) or websites ([DVS](https://library.duke.edu/data/) | [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/)) for details on the upcoming workshop schedule.

> Rfun values the broad diversity and generous spirit found within the R community.  To that end, if you have an idea for a workshop, or want to present, please get in touch.  Please also be aware of the [RLadies of the Triangle](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) group -- a great way to learn more about R!

This past semester Rfun saw new heights in attendance.  We experienced the largest number of attendees since the R learning series began.  Meanwhile the Duke community continues learning more about the adaptable utility of R and the Tidyverse.  Together we are learning about and creating open, shareable, and [tidy data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data) workflows.  We remain focused on reproducibility by exploring the principles of literate coding.  Using these transparent processes we can produce multiple output formats (MS Word, HTML, e-books, slides, PDF, websites, etc.) directly from our analysis scripts.

As an example of how R can contribute to your open and reproducible publishing, notice that most of our workshop materials are created using R/Tidyverse tools, including many of the slide decks and even this [Rfun website](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/).  With the help of many useful packages in the Tidyverse (and beyond) -- and thanks to the package developers --  you can do this as well.  We look forward to learning more with you throughout the coming spring 2019 semester.
