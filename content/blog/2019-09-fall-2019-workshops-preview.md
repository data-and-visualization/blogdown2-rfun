We invite you to join us for an informative semester of workshops about R, RStudio, and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).  Our Rfun workshops  provide a gentle hands-on introduction to a powerful "data first" programming language, R.  The R ecosystem is tweaked for research through data analysis and will grow gracefully with your needs. Best of all, R anticipates reproducibility as a foundational asset of your research workflow.  We look forward to showing you how R can work for you. 

### New this fall

**We are launching** [**R Open Labs**](/portfolio/r_open_labs/) as semi-structure lab time designed to help you learn R and polish your skills. We will meet on Monday evenings at 6pm in the Edge Workshop Room.  Registration is recommended (secure your seat) but not required.  Please [check our schedule](https://duke.libcal.com/event/5497862) or see our [FAQ](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/r_open_labs/).

> Rfun values the broad diversity and generous spirit found within the R community.  To that end, if you have an idea for a workshop, or want to present, please get in touch.  Please also be aware of the [RLadies of the Triangle](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) group -- a great way to learn more about R!

&nbsp;

There is no cost for these workshops.  Registration is for in-person attendance only.  **Fortunately** the resources are recorded and shareable.  You can find links to previous workshop resources (code, video, Github) under the [workshops section of the Rfun website](/#portfolio).  Beyond R, our [Center for Data & Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data) offer [workshops](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops) and [previously recorded resources](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops/past-workshops) on many topics including data management, mapping and GIS, and visualization.
