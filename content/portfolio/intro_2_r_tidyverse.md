*To the Tidyverse, and Beyond...*	

A gentle introduction to R and the Tidyverse using RStudio. Learn about managing your R projects, data types, variable assignments, data structures, and packages such as: tidyverse (dplyR) and ggvis. Attendees will have the opportunity of supplementing the materials covered in this workshop with free academic access to the interactive training workshops at [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com/).

[Joel Herndon](https://joelherndon.info/) and [I](https://johnlittle.info/) regularly offer this **Intro to R Workshop** hosted by the [Data and Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/).  Typically, this section is offered once a month.  The best way to find out to is subscribe to Rfun [workshop annoucement list](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/subscribe/rfun). 

The workshops -- entitled *Intro to R: Data Transformations, Data Structures, and the Tidyverse*  -- is a the two-hour, hands-on session designed to provide a gentle introduction to the basics of the [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/), which is an approachable set of consistent data science tools, and the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language.  We use the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) development environment.  Attendees learn about managing R projects, data types, variable assignments, and data wrangling.  

Visualization (`ggplot2`) and mapping/GIS (`sf`) are introduced as time allows. However both packages are complex enough that we offer separate workshops for each topic.
