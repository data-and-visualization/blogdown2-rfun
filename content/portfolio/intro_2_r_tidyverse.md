*To the Tidyverse, and Beyond...*	

A gentle introduction to R and the [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) using RStudio. This **two-hour, hands-on session** introduces **data wrangling, data types, variable assignments, and packages**.  Our focus will be the Tidyverse, specifically the dplyr and ggvis packages. Tidyverse, is an approachable set of consistent data science tools enabling the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language.

For **visualization** we introduce `ggvis`.  Beyond ggvis, we may also introduce `ggplot2` and `sf`  (mapping/GIS) as time allows. Both ggplot2 and sf packages are complex enough that we offer separate [workshops](/#portfolio) for each topic.

Typically, this workshop is offered once a month.  The best way to find out about future workshops is by subscribing to Rfun [workshop annoucement list](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/subscribe/rfun) or browsing our broader listing of [DVS workshops](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops).
