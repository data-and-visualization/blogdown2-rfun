*To the Tidyverse, and Beyond...*	

A gentle introduction to R and the Tidyverse.  This suite of data savvy tools and techniques enable flexible reporting via literate programming as a means to achieve reproducible and transparent analysis.

The workshop begins with a measured and deliberate orientation to the RStudio interface.  Participants will import data (readr).  We continue with a step-by-step approach to transform and wrangle data (dplyr).  Finally, we introduce basic exploratory data analysis (EDA.)  Participants can expect **explanation**, **demonstration** and code examples along **with hands-on learning**.

As time allows we may introduce visualization and mapping.  See:  Next Steps (below.)

### Register
Typically, this workshop is offered once a month.  The best way to find out about future workshops is by subscribing to Rfun [workshop annoucement list](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/subscribe/rfun) or browsing our broader listing of [DVS workshops](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops).

### Next Steps.
Many researchers will want to add **visualization** and **spatial analysis** to their research workflow.  We recommend `ggplot2` and `sf` packages, respectively.  Both ggplot2 and sf packages are complex enough that we offer separate [workshops](/#portfolio) for each topic.  

For **visualization** offer at least one level of formal workshop on [visualization with ggplot2](/portfolio/ggplot_workshop/).  

Mapping and spatial analysis using the `sf`, `leaflet`, and `mapview` packages. We offer at least one level of workshops on [spatial analysis with R](/portfolio/mapping_workshop/).
