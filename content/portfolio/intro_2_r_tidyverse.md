*To the Tidyverse, and Beyond...*	

A gentle introduction to R and the Tidyverse.  This suite of data savvy tools and techniques enable flexible reporting via literate programming as a means to achieve reproducible and transparent analysis.

The workshop begins with a measured and deliberate orientation to the RStudio interface.  Participants will import data (readr).  We continue with a step-by-step approach to transform and wrangle data (dplyr).  Finally, we introduce basic exploratory data analysis (EDA.)  Participants can expect **explanation**, **demonstration** and code examples along **with hands-on learning**.
