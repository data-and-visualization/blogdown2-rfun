**Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel** presents **Shiny**.  Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host stand-alone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. This short course will introduce you to building web applications with Shiny, reactive programming, and customizing and deploying your apps for others to use.

Prerequisite:  Intro to R. All attendees are expected to be basically familiar with R, R Studio, and the Tidyverse.
