Version control enables single authors or group collaborators to create and share project timelines, transparently tell the story of a project, manage collaboration, experiment with alternative options, and create back-up repositories.  Git is one of the dominant, open-source, version control applications. GitHub is social coding and project cloud tool fed by a git remote.

<!-- **Past workshops have focused on using RStudio**, which happens to be an excellent git client.  This time, we'll be more general.  We will discuss RStudio but focus mostly on git and GitHub. -->
	
### Version Control & Git

In this hands-on workshop you will discover how to harness Git to support the execution of more reproducible research projects. Git is a powerful version control system.  

### GitHub: Portfolios & Social Coding

GitHub is a social coding platform<!-- which enable collaboration.-->  Built upon the Git (version control) application these tools make social coding and code sharing more accessible.  Learn how to <!-- create branches, create remote repositories--> Use RStudio and the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package to leverage version conrol with git & GitHub. <!-- /GitLab interface for simpler reverts, and collaborate with others.-->
