Version control enables single authors or group collaborators to create and share project timelines, transparently tell the story of a project, manage collaboration, experiment with alternative options, and create back-up repositories.  Git is one of the dominant, open-source, version control applications. GitHub is social coding and project cloud tool fed by a git remote.

Come learn how all this works and create your own "Hello World" GitHub repository.

**Past workshops have focused on using RStudio**, which happens to be an excellent git client.  This time, we'll be more general.  We will discuss RStudio but focus mostly on git and GitHub.
	
### Version Control & Git

In this hands-on workshop you will discover how to harness Git to support the execution of more reproducible research projects. Git is a powerful version control system.  

### GitHub: Portfolios & Social Coding

GitHub and GitLab are social coding platforms which enable collaboration.  Built upon the Git (version control) application these tools make social coding and code sharing more accessible.  Learn how to create branches, create remote repositories, leverage the GitHub/GitLab interface for simpler reverts, and collaborate with others.
