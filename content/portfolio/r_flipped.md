R and the Tidyverse are a data-first coding language that enables reproducible analytics workflows.  In this two-part workshop, you’ll learn the fundamentals of R, everything you need to know to quickly get started.

In **Part 1** you’ll learn how to access and install RStudio, how to wrangle data for analysis, gain a brief introduction to visualization, practice Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and how to generate reports.  In **Part 2** you’ll learn about visualization using ggplot2, how to make interactive charts for use in dashboards, how to reshape and merge data, and be introduced to models.

**Part 1 has no prerequisites** and no prior experience is necessary. By the end of part 1 you will import data, edit and save scripts, subset data, use projects to organize your work, and develop self-help techniques.

**Part 2 requires the familiarity of part 1.**  By the end of part 2 you will have a familiarity with the grammar of graphics, be introduced to interactivity techniques, be able to invoke data joins and pivots, and gain an introduction to linear regression.
