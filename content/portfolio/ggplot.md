Angela Zoss ([DVS Staff page](https://library.duke.edu/data/about/staff)) presents a **visualization** workshop hosted by the [Data and Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/).

The workshops, officially entitled *Visualization in R using ggplot2*, is a two-hour, hands-on learning session designed to introduce the **ggplot2** package, a library package within the R programming language.  **ggplot2 for R enables you to create clear and well-designed visualizations**. 

Data science skills are increasingly important for research and industry projects.  With complex data science projects, however, come complex needs for understanding and communicating analysis processes and results.  Ultimately, an analyst's data science toolbox is incomplete without visualization skills.  Incorporating effective visualizations directly into the analysis tool you are using can facilitate quick data exploration, streamline your research process, and improve the reproducibility of your research.
