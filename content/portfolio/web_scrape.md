**Dr.  Colin Rundel** shows how to gathering data from the web with **rvest**.  Web Scraping presents unique challenges to the researcher. Only rarely is the data we need available as a tidy rectangle that can be easily imported and directly analyzed. During this workshop we will discuss some of the common data formats (e.g. json, xml) and data sources (e.g. APIs, web scraping) as well as the tools / packages / best practicesÂ for ingesting these data using the R programming language.  This workshop includes case-specific introductory examples of *purrr::map*

Prerequisite:  Intro to R. All attendees are expected to be basically familiar with R, R Studio, and the Tidyverse.
