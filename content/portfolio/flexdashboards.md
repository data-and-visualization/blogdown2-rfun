Learn to layout dashboards with interactive filters; Using crosstalk, enable your audience to filter or subset one plot via subsetting an independent plot (i.e. *linked brushing*); add interactivity to your ggplot2 plots with easy-to-use HTMLWidgets such as plotly via the `ggplotly()` function.

Prerequisite:  [Intro to R](/portfolio/intro2r_workshop/). All attendees are expected to be basically familiar with R, R Studio, and the Tidyverse.  Strongly recommended: [Visualization with ggplot2](/portfolio/ggplot_workshop/).
