R markdown is a means of applying structure to the prose in your coding document. Using R Markdown and the `xaringan` package, attendees will integrate code with natural language (i.e. prose) to render presentation slides as a reproducible report.  The method of integrating code with prose is known as [literate coding techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).
