## Loading Data

*Load the file into a new variable called `westUnion`?*

- The data are in a *CSV* file on your local workstation which needs to be loaded into R.  The data file is in a directory relative to your Rmd script: `data/westUnion.csv`.

Write the R code required to load csv data:

```{r read_csv, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r read_csv-solution}
westUnion <- read_csv("data/westUnion.csv")
# Note...  Code will not run in this tutorial window
# Use an R Notebook to practice this exercise.
```


Hints:

- One option is to use the *Import Dataset* feature of RStudio from the *File* menubar. Code will be generated for you -- which you can run immediately -- or look to the bottom of the dialogue box and copy the code you can run as a code chunk.

## Data Type

```{r datatype}
quiz(
  question("What function will tell you the data type for westUnion?",
    answer("glimpse(westUnion)"),
    answer("tbl_vars(westUnion)"),
    answer("class(westUnion)", correct = TRUE),
    answer("str(westUnion)")
  ),
  question("The data type for westUnion is?",
    answer("Data Frame", message = "A modern data frame is known as a Tibble"),
    answer("List"),
    answer("Character"),
    answer("Tibble", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Matrix")
  )
)
```


## Data Structure

Take a look at the structure of the `westUnion` variable.

```{r dataStructure}
quiz(
    question("What is the best command to concisely learn more about 
             the variables, observations, and data types 
             within a Tibble",
             answer("class(westUnion)"),
             answer("glimpse(westUnion)", correct = TRUE),
             answer("tbl_vars(westUnion)"),
             answer("str(westUnion)", message = "This works but is 
                    not a conscise report"),
             answer("westUnion", message = "This will work but 
                    require a lot of mouse-clicking on your part")
           ),
  question("How many observations (rows) are there?",
           answer("59", correct = TRUE),
           answer("4, 4, 6, 8, 7, 8, 9, 4,..."),
           answer("7"),
           answer("None of the Above")
           ),
  question("How many variables (columns) are there?",
           answer("59"),
           answer("4 4 6 8 7 8 9 4 9 9 ..."),
           answer("7", correct = TRUE),
           answer("All of the above")
           ),
  question("How many of the variables are numeric data?",
           answer("59"),
           answer("7"),
           answer("5"),
           answer("2", correct = TRUE)
           )
  )
```
